## **Important Note for Codespaces**
1. Description for different code files:

(1)**Abrupt_Gradual_Env_code.py**: Code for increasing the number of price options impact the regret of the algorithms.

(2)**Basic_Algorithms_Performance.py**: Code for completing the missing functions for Fixed-Exploration-Greedy, Epsilon-Greedy, Decaying Epsilon-Greedy, 
                                        UCB, and Thompson Sampling, and ploting the Bandit Algorithm Performance of these five algorithms.

(3)**Dynamic_Pricing_code.py**: Code for modifying the experiment to include gradual (rather than abrupt) shifts in reward probabilities.

(4)**CMAB_NN_code.py**: Code for neural networks and contextual multi-armed bandit algorithm.
